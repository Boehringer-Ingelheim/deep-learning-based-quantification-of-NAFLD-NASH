# Deep learning-based Quantification of NAFLD/NASH progression in human liver biopsies

This repository contains source code related to the publication "Deep learning-based quantification of NAFLD/NASH progression in human liver biopsies", Heinemann et al., Scientific Reports, 2022 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23905-3.

The method analyzes microscopy images of human liver biopsies stained in Masson' Trichrome or Goldner stain. As result the four features of the pathologist-based Kleiner score (Statosis, Ballooning, Inflammation and Fibrosis) are generated. The features are in the identical numerical range as the pathologist score (e.g. 0-4 for fibrosis) but on a continuous scale.
